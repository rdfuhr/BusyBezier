The purpose of this folder is to implement an HTML5 and JavaScript version of my BusyBezier app.

If this works, then I will try implementing an HTML5 and JavaScript version of my BusyBSpline app.

I will also try managing this with git and using GitHub.

I was able to stage and commit the first version of the README.txt file.

Now I have checked it out and am adding these lines and will check it back in.

I will use this file to keep track of what I have learned and what still puzzles me.

What puzzles me is when I go into my git account, I can not find the file README.txt in GitHub.  Why would that be.

Note that I am now in the following directory:
/Users/richardfuhr/Dropbox/Public/Sandbox/javaScriptLearn/gitPractice/BusyBezier

and my default directory in my SourceTree settings is the project folder

/Users/richardfuhr/Dropbox/Public/Sandbox/javaScriptLearn/gitPractice/

After a bit of a pause, README.txt shows up in the working tree in the SourceTree window.

That is reassuring. I want to move it from “Files in the working tree” to “Files staged in the index”  I was able to drag and drop it there, but if I do a save, will it move it back to the working tree?  No it didn’t.  Oh, now it did, and there is one in both.

What if I drag the one in the working tree to the index?  That seemed to work.

I am now editing the README.txt file using vi.  I want to see whether this shows up in git status when I save the changes.
