The purpose of this folder is to implement an HTML5 and JavaScript version of my BusyBezier app.

If this works, then I will try implementing an HTML5 and JavaScript version of my BusyBSpline app.

I will also try managing this with git and using GitHub.

I was able to stage and commit the first version of the README.txt file.

Now I have checked it out and am adding these lines and will check it back in.
